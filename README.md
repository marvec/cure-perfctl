# cure-perfctl
A very simple utility to remove the perfctl malware.

First, it is important to note that you need to remove the vulnerability from your system first, otherwise it will keep getting reinfected.

The easiest way is always to reinstall the machine from scratch as this leads to the latest versions of software being installed.

This utility works on our Debian 12 machines. Before blindly running it, please see what is inside and tweak accordingly.

The tool reboots the machine abruptly, possibly leaving something in an unpredictable state.

Run as root.
